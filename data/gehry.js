            <h2>Frank Gehry</h2>
            <h3>Canadian American Architect, 1929 ~</h3>
            <p>
                Frank Gehry was born in a working-class Jewish neighborhood of Toronto, Canada, in 1929. He
                remembered
                vividly
                watching carp swimming in the bathtub while his grandmother prepared to make gefilte fish in
                the
                kitchen.
                The
                fish form would later become a constant theme in his work.

            Gehry's family migrated to California from Toronto in 1947. He got a job driving a delivery
            truck and studied at LA City College. He tried ceramics, radio announcing and chemical engineering
            before he finally chose architecture.</p>
        <p>
            In 1954, Gehry graduated from University of Southern California with a Bachelor of
            Architecture degree.

            Early in his career, Gehry made friends with many contemporary artists in L.A and designed furniture to participate in art exhibitions. He wanted to express architecture more artistically too, but he was considered a ‚Äúcontractor‚Äôs architect‚Äù, and worked largely on generic developments. 
            </p>
            <p>
            In 1977, Gehry and his wife Berta bought a bungalow in LA, originally built in 1920. Berta encouraged Gehry to fully exercise his creative ideas. This remodel became his first experimental design.
            </p>
            <p>
            His home renovation gained him recognition from the architecture world. In the following decade, he began to receive more and more commissions to design imaginative structures.

            In 1987, the Disney Concert Hall project was initiated. At this time, Gehry was known for using cheap materials to produce a post-industrial deconstruction design. While he always loved arts and music venues, he didn‚Äôt think he would win commission from Disney. Nevertheless, he submitted his design and won the competition in 1988. 
        </p><p>
            This design continued his signature theme of the deconstruction of the form, but the facade called for a bright stoney texture. The structure stood out as elegant as the Disney family wanted.
