        <h2>Jørn Utzon</h2>
        <h3>Danish Architect, 1918 ~ 2008</h3>
        <p>
            Jørn Utzon was born in Denmark. While in secondary school, he began helping his father,
            director of a shipyard, and a brilliant naval architect, by studying new designs, drawing up plans and making
            models. He thought he might train to be a naval architect like his father.

                Utzon’s uncle Einar Utzon-Frank was a sculptor and professor at the Royal Academy of Fine
                Arts. Under his influence, Utzon took an interest in sculpting.

                In 1937 he was admitted into the Royal
                Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, and graduated with an architecture degree in 1942.

                In 1952, Utzon built his family residence in Hellebæk, Denmark. This was Utzon’s first
                completed
                work, aside from a water tower in Svaneke. Utzon directed the construction work without any
                technical plans. As the building developed he would often change its shape, modifying its
                design.

                He learned this approach in Finland in 1946 when he apprenticed under Alvar Aalto, who had
                used
                the same method
                for his Villa Mairea. While Aalto mained this method was the most economical solution for
                building a
                house, this way of working planted the seed for the bitter fruit that came after Utzon
                winning
                the
                commission of the Sydney Opera House.
