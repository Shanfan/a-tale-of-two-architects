                        Jørn Utzon and Frank Gehry are both masters of curved architectural lines. That’s as far as
                        their design signatures could overlap.
                    </p>
                    <p>They both have been honored with the prestigious Pritzker
                        Architecture

                    Utzon completed his architectural training in Denmark during World War II when Germany occupied the
                    country. In the first two decades following his training, there were limited opportunities for
                    large-scale projects in a war-torn Europe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gehry finished his architectural training just before the urban construction boom in Los Angeles. In
                    the
                    initial two decades after his training, he had already amassed a wealth of construction experience
                    that
                    many architects would not typically acquire until much later in their careers.

                    Utzon got his first high-profile international project, the Sydney Opera House, at the age of 39, a
                    relatively young age for an architect. It turned into a fiasco and damaged his reputation. Large
                    project
                    clients had shunned Utzon for decades after the Sydney Opera House project. The Opera House remained
                    his
                    sole internationally renowned undertaking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, Gehry got his first significant international project, the Bilbao Guggenheim
                    museum,
                    at the age of 64. By then, he had had more experience in navigating complicated business and
                    political
                    interests; in addition, Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software had also become available. Gehry’s firm
                    was
                    a pioneer in using software modeling for greater precision in transitioning from design to
                    manufacturing.

                    The Bilbao Museum was not only a sensational success but also an economical one. On time and under
                    budget, this project opened doors for Gehry to embark on increasingly grand and audacious projects
                    for
                    the next three decades.

                    The Sydney Opera House transformed the image of a young country. The culture, tourism, and economic
                    growth brought about by this iconic structure in the following half-century would ultimately offset
                    the
                    cost of its construction. However, how do we gauge its impact on Utzon's career? How do we assess
                    all
                    the remarkable buildings that Utzon could have created but was never permitted to design?

                    Jørn Utzon, at the age of 85, was finally honored with the prestigious Pritzker Architect Prize. By
                    this
                    time, he had become too frail to attend the ceremony in person, and his son accepted the honor on
                    his
                    behalf.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As if fate had intervened, Frank Gehry, a Pritzker laureate of 14 years, served as one of the jurors
                    in
                    2003. Gehry spoke of Utzon, not unlike someone who had fought in the same battle:
                </p>
                <blockquote
                    cite="https://www.pritzkerprize.com/sites/default/files/inline-files/Tom_Pritzker_Ceremony_Speech_2003_Utzon.pdf">
                    <p>
                        He made a building well ahead of its time, far ahead of available technology, and he persevered
                        through extraordinary malicious publicity and negative criticism to build a building that
                        changed
                        the image of an entire country. It’s the first time in our lifetime that an epic piece of
                        architecture gained such a universal presence.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    He also acknowledged that it was Utzon’s pioneering effort with the Sydney Opera House that paved
                    the
                    way for his own Guggenheim project in Bilbao.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While Gehry was overseeing the Bilbao Guggenheim project (1993-1997), his other project, the
                    Disney Concert Hall (1991-2003), faced similar <q>malicious publicity and negative criticism.</q> He
                    found
                    himself on the verge of being forced out, much like Utzon. Fortunately, the success of the Bilbao
                    Guggenheim and the support of Disney family donors allowed Gehry to see the Disney Concert Hall to
                    completion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Gehry wrapped up the Disney Hall project and sat on the Pritzker juror’s board, what might have
                    gone
                    through his mind?
